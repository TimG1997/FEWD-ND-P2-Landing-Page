# Dynamic Navigation bar (2nd project of the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree)

This repository contains the full code for the second project of the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree. The starter code can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page.
The project is about implementing a dynamic navigation bar, which picks up new sections automatically and is able to scroll to the correct section, when the corresponding navigation item is clicked.

The navigation bar highlights also the navigation item of the section, which is in the current viewport.
